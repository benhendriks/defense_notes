A working reference built around the five BTL1 domains. Cheat sheets, detection workflows, CLI references, and investigation notes — written for use during active lab sessions, not for passive reading before an exam.

If you're mid-investigation and need a filter, a query pattern, or a quick artifact reference, this is the place to grep.

## Searching locally

Everything is plain Markdown. Clone once and grep during lab sessions — no setup, no dependencies.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nervi0z/btl1-field-notes
cd btl1-field-notes
```
```bash
# search by Windows Event ID
grep -rnw . -e 'EventCode=4624'

# find Volatility 3 module syntax
grep -rnw 03_Digital_Forensics/ -e 'windows.malfind'

# look up SPL patterns
grep -rnw 04_SIEM_Analysis/ -e 'stats count by'

# search across phishing references
grep -rnw 01_Phishing_Analysis/ -e 'Return-Path'
```
